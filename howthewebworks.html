        <b>2. What is URL?</b>
        <p>A: URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator which is an address for internet resource.</p>
        
        <b>3. What is DNS?</b>
        <p>   A: DNS stands for Domain Name System that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.</p>
        
        <b>4. What is a query string?</b>
        <p>A: A query string is a part of the URL that assigns value to the specified parameters.</p>
        
        <b>5. List two HTTP Verbs and their use cases.</b>
        <p> A: 1. Get - gets data from the servers
        2. Post - changes data on servers</p>
        
        <b>6. What is an HTTP request?</b>
        <p>A: It is an URL request from a client to the server.</p>
        
        <b>7. What is an HTTP response?</b>
        <p>A: It is a response sent by the server to the client as per their request.</p>
        
        <b>8. What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</b>
        <p>A: HTTP header provide additional information about the request or response . For example
            Request Headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
            Response Headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control</p>
        
        <b>9. What happens when you type a “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” in a browser?</b>
        <p>A: 1. The browser uses DNS to find the IP address for this site.
            2. The request is made to the IP address.
            3. The server sends a response.
            4. The browser makes a DOM from that response.</p>
        
        
        <h3>PART TWO: PRACTICE TOOLS</h3>
        
        <b>1. Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”</b>
        
        <p>A: curl https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search\?term\=pirate</p>
        
       <b> 2. Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com</b>
        <p>A: ;; ANSWER SECTION:</p>
            <p>icanhazdadjoke.com.	300	IN	A	104.21.37.176</p>
            <p>icanhazdadjoke.com.	300	IN	A	172.67.211.64</p>
